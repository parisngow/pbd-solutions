/* 1. Else and if else are blocks of code the program will defalt to when the
condition of the if statement before them results in a false statement.
2. If the else if removed in one of the else if statements then the program will
treat it as a seperate if statement to be reviewed on it's own. With the else, the
program will use it as a 'backup' to default to when the if statement before it is false.
